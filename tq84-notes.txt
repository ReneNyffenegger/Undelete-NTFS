When you delete files or folders, the data isn't initially removed from the
hard disk. Instead, the space on the disk that was occupied by the deleted data
is deallocated. After it's deallocated, the space is available to use when new
data is written to the disk. Until the space is overwritten, you can recover
the deleted data by using a low-level disk editor or data-recovery software.
